**Version 4.1.6** · [Website](https://mcp-guardian-cloud.vercel.app) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mcp-guardian/server) · [Install & troubleshooting](docs/INSTALL.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

### What's new in 4.1.6

- **`mcp-guardian start`** — one command for proxy + web dashboard on port 4000 (local dev defaults)
- **`mcp-guardian setup`** — one-shot install for git clones (`pnpm install`, build, dashboard SPA)
- **npm tarball** — prebuilt dashboard UI (`deploy/dashboard-spa/out/`) built at publish time
- **Install guide** — expanded troubleshooting in README and [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

### What's new in 4.1.5

- **npm install** — fixes broken `@mcp-guardian/server@4.1.4` registry manifest (`workspace:` deps). Use **4.1.5+**.

### What's new in 4.1.4

- **`mcp-guardian onboard` from global npm** — resolves the installed package root (not `cwd`); writes `guardian-configs/` under your current directory; ships `scripts/guardian-proxy.sh` and `policy-audit.yaml` in the npm tarball

### What's new in 4.1.3

**npm install fix** — registry manifest now matches published tarballs (`^4.1.3` semver deps, not `workspace:`). Use `@mcp-guardian/server@4.1.3` or later. Publish via `./scripts/publish-npm-all.sh` (server/CLI ship from `.tgz` so metadata stays correct).

### What's new in 4.1.1

**npm install hygiene** — fixes supply-chain scanner findings from 4.1.0:

- Published tarballs no longer include `postinstall` or other lifecycle scripts
- `workspace:` dependencies are rewritten to semver (`^4.1.1`) at pack time
- Publish **all** packages via `./scripts/publish-npm-all.sh` (core → plugin-sdk → server → cli)

### What's new in 4.1.0

**Industry roadmap plan compliance** — runtime verification and dashboard wiring for all eleven fleet-wide modules (A1–C5, B1–B3):

- **`guardian roadmap audit`** — CLI + `GET /api/agentic/plan-compliance/audit` verify every shipped module; exit 0 when production-ready
- **Dashboard Agentic AI panels** — PlanCompliance, Reputation, ZeroTrust, FederatedLearning, Observatory mesh sync, SandboxWizard captured-traffic scorecard, ChainGraph (A1)
- **Protection home strip** — roadmap compliance score on the main Protection tab with link to Agentic AI
- **A1 ONNX graph path** — optional fleet chain classifier via `GUARDIAN_FLEET_GRAPH_ONNX_MODEL`
- **B3 MPC-lite masking** — pairwise-masked federated gradients (`GUARDIAN_FEDERATED_MPC`)
- **B2/B1 mesh relays** — observatory and reputation mesh publish/pull; dev stub via `GUARDIAN_OBSERVATORY_STUB`
- **Docs & env** — `guardian roadmap *` commands documented; production env vars in `.env.example`

Run `guardian roadmap audit --json` or open **Agentic AI → Overview** in the dashboard to confirm 100% compliance.

### What's new in 4.0.0

**Industry-standard MCP protection** — Guardian moves from per-call filtering to fleet-wide, cross-agent security:

- **MTX v1** — open threat exchange format (`@mcp-guardian/mtx`) + cloud hub
- **Guardian Certified MCP** — HMAC attestation, persistent registry, verification API
- **Multi-step attack chains** — collusion detector + session-chain graph with proxy enforcement
- **Capability graph & intent binding** — tool/resource graph and session intent allowlists
- **Agent reputation ledger** — persistent scores with proxy enforcement
- **Dynamic sandbox tiers** — shadow / redact / allow with RL-ready persistence
- **Protocol fuzzer** — expanded corpus with real block validation and cert gates
- **Policy simulator** — `/api/policy/simulate` + `ab_test_policy` MCP tool
- **Incident playbooks & AI investigator** — webhook/isolate executors; Threat Lab–linked investigations
- **Compliance evidence runner** — live policy + audit wired to SOC2/HIPAA/PCI/FedRAMP/ISO mappings
- **guardian-bench** — `mcp-guardian bench` CLI + public leaderboard

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for 3.4.1 production hardening (JWKS refresh, payload limits, SIEM on all block paths, audit retention).

**Roadmap (shipped in 4.0):** Semantic policy translator with approval flows, config provenance chain, STRIDE/LINDDUN threat modeling, behavioral biometrics, cross-MCP attack chains with SIEM export, digital twin sandbox, zero-trust SPIFFE scoring, decentralized reputation network, ecosystem observatory, insurance risk quantification + PDF export, and federated threat detection — [docs/AGENTIC_ROADMAP.md](docs/AGENTIC_ROADMAP.md).

### Fleet mandate for CISO buyers

Guardian v4 is designed as a **fleet-wide control plane**, not a single-proxy filter:

- **Mandatory policy provenance** — every YAML change is hash-chained, signed, and exportable to SIEM/auditors
- **Human-in-the-loop policy approval** — NL drafts must pass simulation + explicit approval before apply
- **Cross-agent attack chain detection** — session graphs span servers; alerts export as CEF for Splunk/Datadog
- **SPIFFE/mTLS identity** — zero-trust composite scores include workload identity from SPIFFE SVIDs
- **Cloud observatory + reputation mesh** — anonymized fleet telemetry and server reputation consensus via MCP Guardian Cloud
- **Insurance-ready risk reports** — ALE quantification with underwriter PDF export for cyber insurance workflows

---

## What problem does this solve?

Modern AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Cline, and others) can connect to **tools** — read files, run commands, query databases, post to Slack, and more. Those connections often use a standard called **MCP** (Model Context Protocol).

That power is useful, but risky:

- The AI might read files it should not see.
- It might run shell commands or delete data by mistake or because of a malicious prompt.
- Secrets can leak through tool arguments.
- API costs can spike without you noticing.

**MCP Guardian sits in the middle.** Every tool request goes through Guardian first. Guardian checks your rules, blocks bad requests, logs what happened, and can show you a live dashboard — **before** anything reaches your real tools.

```
Your AI assistant
       │
       ▼
  MCP Guardian  ← reads your rules, blocks bad calls, keeps a log
       │
       ▼
  Your real tools (files, GitHub, database, …)
```

---

## How it works (step by step)

1. **You install Guardian** and point it at your existing MCP setup (or run `mcp-guardian onboard` to do this automatically).
2. **Guardian wraps your tool servers** so the AI talks to Guardian instead of talking to them directly.
3. When the AI tries to use a tool, Guardian receives the request first.
4. Guardian compares the request to your **policy** (a simple rules file you control).
5. If the request is allowed, Guardian forwards it to the real tool and returns the result.
6. If the request breaks a rule, Guardian **blocks it** and tells the AI it was denied — the real tool never runs.
7. Every allow and block is saved to a local database so you can review history and see charts on the dashboard.

You stay in control: Guardian does not silently change your rules unless you approve it (for example when reviewing Threat Lab suggestions).

## Architecture

This section shows how MCP Guardian is wired together: what runs where, how a tool call flows through governance, and how optional Pro pipelines connect to the proxy.

**In this section:** [System overview](#system-overview) · [Tool call path](#tool-call-path-tools_call) · [Transports](#transports) · [Agentic AI](#agentic-ai-integration) · [Dashboard](#dashboard-and-observability) · [Pro pipelines](#pro-pipeline-architecture) · [Learning loop](#continuous-improvement-loop)

### System overview

When you run **`mcp-guardian start`** or `pnpm dashboard:proxy`, one Node process typically hosts the **policy proxy**, the **dashboard API**, and (optionally) **agentic services**. All components share the same audit database (`MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH`, default `~/.mcp-guardian/history.db`).

| Component | Role | Main code |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Proxy layer** | Intercepts JSON-RPC; enforces policy on every `tools/call` | [`src/proxy/`](src/proxy/) |
| **Policy engine** | Evaluates YAML rules, rate limits, RBAC, patterns | [`src/policy/`](src/policy/) |
| **History DB** | Stores allow/block audit, tokens, cost | [`src/database/history-db.ts`](src/database/history-db.ts) |
| **Dashboard** | Local UI + REST API over the same DB | [`deploy/dashboard-spa/`](deploy/dashboard-spa/), [`src/utils/dashboard-server.ts`](src/utils/dashboard-server.ts) |
| **Agentic** | Smart features (injection scan, policy gen, trust, etc.) | [`src/agentic/`](src/agentic/) |

Enterprise deployments may add **Redis** (rate limits, DPoP, circuit-breaker sync) and **PostgreSQL** instead of SQLite — see [ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Tool call path (`tools/call`)

Every dangerous decision happens **before** the real MCP server runs. If Guardian blocks a call, the upstream tool never receives it.

```mermaid

  participant Client as AI client
  participant Transport as Proxy transport
  participant PreGuard as Pre-forward guard
  participant Policy as PolicyEngine

        Transport-->>Client: JSON-RPC result
        Transport->>Audit: allow record
      end
    end
  end
```

**Integration details:**

1. **Pre-forward guard** ([`src/proxy/tool-call-pre-guard.ts`](src/proxy/tool-call-pre-guard.ts)) — caps expanded argument size and runs agentic pre-hooks (prompt injection, etc.) on all transports.
2. **Policy** ([`src/policy/policy-engine.ts`](src/policy/policy-engine.ts)) — your YAML rules; rate-limit counters survive hot-reload via [`src/policy/rate-limit-store.ts`](src/policy/rate-limit-store.ts).
3. **Semantic gate** ([`src/proxy/proxy-post-policy-gates.ts`](src/proxy/proxy-post-policy-gates.ts)) — optional LLM/heuristic check on arguments before forward.
4. **Audit** — [`persistCallRecord`](src/utils/call-record-cost.ts) → async [`audit-write-queue`](src/database/audit-write-queue.ts) → SQLite; blocks also emit [`StructuredLogger.logBlocked`](src/utils/structured-logger.ts) for SIEM.

### Transports

Guardian implements the same governance stack on every MCP transport your IDE might use:

| Transport | Entry module | `tools/call` governance |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **stdio** | [`src/proxy/proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/proxy-server.ts) | Full pipeline (default for wrapped configs) |
| **HTTP** | [`src/proxy/http-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/http-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |
| **SSE** | [`src/proxy/sse-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/sse-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |
| **WebSocket** | [`src/proxy/websocket-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/websocket-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |
| **Streamable HTTP** | [`src/proxy/streamable-http-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/streamable-http-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |

Run `mcp-guardian onboard` so client configs point at Guardian-wrapped servers. If an IDE connects to an MCP server **around** Guardian (common with raw SSE URLs), calls are **untracked** — metrics and logs will show `sse_untracked`.

### Agentic AI integration

Agentic features are optional modules loaded at boot ([`src/container.ts`](src/container.ts)). They do not replace your YAML policy; they add observation, scoring, and recommendations.

| Integration point | What happens |
|-------------------|--------------|

| **MCP tools** | ~35 agentic tools registered in [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) for automation and dashboard actions |
| **Modules** | 40+ agentic modules in [`src/agentic/`](src/agentic/) (prediction, policy-gen, mesh, collusion, reputation, etc.) |
| **Dashboard** | **Agentic AI** workspace reads [`/api/agentic/*`](src/utils/agentic-dashboard-summary.ts) summaries |
| **Database** | Agentic state in [`011-agentic-tables.sql`](src/database/migrations/011-agentic-tables.sql) |

### Dashboard and observability

```mermaid

  Proxy[Proxy writes] --> DB[(history.db)]
  DB --> REST[Dashboard REST API]
  REST --> SPA[Next.js SPA\nProtection Activity Agentic]
  REST --> WS[WebSocket push\nGUARDIAN_WS_ENABLED]
  Proxy --> Prom[Prometheus metrics\noptional]
  Proxy --> SIEM[SIEM exporters\nMCP_GUARDIAN_SIEM_ENABLED]
```

The dashboard is not a separate database — it reads the same `call_records` the proxy writes. Set `MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH` consistently when running `pnpm real-life:filesystem` or other tests so charts match proxy traffic.

### Pro pipeline architecture

These Pro workflows run **alongside** the live proxy. They consume audit data, swarm reports, and LLM output to improve detection — they do not sit in the hot path of every tool call.

#### Security Swarm

Automated red-team loop: generate attacks, run the harness, detect bypasses, feed learning.

![Security Swarm architecture — scout, harness, bypass detection, and learning feedback](docs/assets/security-swarm-architecture.png)

- **What it does:** Runs scripted steps (build, corpus eval, parity, harness) and records bypasses when policy allows an attack that should be blocked.
- **How it connects:** Reads/writes under `reports/security-swarm/`; bypasses and proposals can inform Threat Lab and runtime attack-learning.
- **Run:** `pnpm security-swarm` (Pro license in production).

#### Threat Lab (LLM discovery)

Human-reviewed LLM proposals for new attack fixtures and policy ideas.

![Threat Lab architecture — Ollama discovery, validation, and candidate manifest](docs/assets/llm-threat-discovery-architecture.png)

- **What it does:** Collects signals (bypasses, semantic TPs, ThreatIntel), asks a local LLM for new corpus candidates, validates them, writes `threat-lab-candidates.json` for **you to accept**.
- **How it connects:** Outputs feed the adversarial harness and optional policy-applier after review — nothing is applied silently.
- **Run:** `pnpm security-swarm:threat-lab` (requires Ollama). See [THREAT_LAB.md](docs/THREAT_LAB.md).

#### Auto Threat Research

Background LLM research when the proxy blocks suspicious traffic; writes validated `adv-*.json` fixtures.

![Auto Threat Research architecture — queued detections to auto corpus fixtures](docs/assets/auto-threat-research-architecture.png)

- **What it does:** Debounces block events, classifies attack types, writes harness fixtures when validation passes (dedupe + rate caps).
- **How it connects:** Uses the same auto-corpus writer as Threat Lab when both `GUARDIAN_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO` and `SWARM_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO` are enabled.
- **Run:** Enable env flags on the proxy host; or trigger from dashboard **Threat Discovery**.

## Features explained

Below is what each major capability does, in plain language.

### Policy proxy (the core)

**What it is:** A filter on every tool call.

**How it works:** You write rules in a YAML file (see [The policy file](#the-policy-file) below). Rules can allow specific tools, deny dangerous ones, limit how often tools run, cap token usage, and match patterns in arguments (for example “block if the path contains `../`”). When you change the file, Guardian can reload rules without restarting.

**Why it matters:** This is your main line of defense — fast, predictable, and fully under your control.

---

### Attack blocking (built into the default policy)

**What it is:** Hundreds of pre-written checks for common abuse.

**How it works:** Before a call reaches your server, Guardian looks for things like shell commands hidden in arguments, path traversal (`../etc/passwd`), SQL injection patterns, attempts to exfiltrate secrets, suspicious URLs, and Unicode tricks that hide malicious text. If a pattern matches, the call is blocked and logged.

**Why it matters:** Many real-world attacks look like normal tool calls; these checks catch a large class of them without an AI model.

---

### Cost tracking

**What it is:** A running tally of how much your tool usage costs.

**How it works:** Guardian estimates tokens and dollar cost per call (using model pricing when available). You can set budgets and see burn rate over time in the dashboard.

**Why it matters:** Runaway agents or loops can get expensive; you see it early.

---

### Health monitoring

**What it is:** A health check for each connected MCP server.

**How it works:** Guardian tracks success rate, latency, and whether a server is responding. If a server keeps failing, a circuit breaker can stop hammering it.

**Why it matters:** You notice broken or flaky integrations before users complain.

---

### Live audit log

**What it is:** A permanent record of what was allowed and what was blocked.

**How it works:** Each decision is stored in a local SQLite database (default: `~/.mcp-guardian/history.db`). The dashboard reads this database to show tables, charts, and filters.

**Why it matters:** Security and debugging need a clear trail — who tried what, when, and why it was blocked.

---

### Package scanning (CVE and typo-squat)

**What it is:** A check on MCP packages before you trust them.

**How it works:** Guardian can scan installed or configured packages for known security issues (CVEs) and names that look like famous packages but are slightly misspelled (typo-squatting).

**Why it matters:** Supply-chain attacks often arrive as “almost the right” package name.

---

### Adversarial harness (offline tests)

**What it is:** A large automated test suite that fires attack-like requests at your policy **without** a live AI.

**How it works:** Run `pnpm harness` from the repo. It replays 800+ fixtures and reports what would be blocked or allowed.

**Why it matters:** You can change rules and immediately see if you broke legitimate use or left a hole open.

---

### Real-life scenarios (live tests)

**What it is:** A short or long run of real attack traffic against a real filesystem MCP server through Guardian.

**How it works:** Commands like `pnpm real-life:filesystem` drive the official filesystem server with path traversal, injection, and similar tests while the proxy is running. Results show up in the dashboard if you use the same database path.

**Why it matters:** Offline tests are fast; live tests prove the full path (proxy → policy → log → UI) works.

---

## Agentic AI features (version 4.1)

### Industry-standard roadmap (shipped in 4.0)

Guardian’s industry-standard layer delivers **cross-server, cross-agent, systemic** protection — what enterprise CISOs need to mandate Guardian fleet-wide. All eleven capabilities shipped in v4.0:

| Tier | Features | Theme |
|------|----------|--------|
| **1 — Paradigm** | A1 Cross-MCP attack chain detection · A2 Digital twin & policy sandbox · A3 Agent behavioral biometrics | See the forest, not just the trees |
| **2 — Ecosystem** | B1 Decentralized reputation network · B2 Ecosystem health observatory · B3 Federated threat detection | Network effects across deployments |
| **3 — Enterprise** | C1 Config provenance chain · C2 Threat modeling as code (STRIDE/LINDDUN) · C3 Zero-trust continuous verification · C4 Insurance risk quantification · C5 Semantic policy translator | Compliance, CFO, and business stakeholders |

**Build order (12 months):** Phase 1 (C5, C1, C2, A3) → Phase 2 (A1, A2, C3) → Phase 3 (B1, B2, C4) → Phase 4 research (B3).

Full detail, foundations already in code, and differentiation rationale: **[docs/AGENTIC_ROADMAP.md](docs/AGENTIC_ROADMAP.md)**.

**Verify compliance:** Run `guardian roadmap audit` (or `--json` for machine-readable output). The dashboard **Agentic AI → Overview** tab shows the same runtime audit via **Industry Roadmap Compliance**. Additional CLI utilities: `guardian roadmap fleet-graph-train`, `federated-export|import`, `observatory-sync`, `reputation-sync`. See [Agentic Quickstart](docs/AGENTIC_QUICKSTART.md#industry-roadmap-cli).

**Production env vars** (optional): fleet chain blocking (`GUARDIAN_FLEET_CHAIN_BLOCK_CONFIDENCE`), multi-region Redis (`GUARDIAN_FLEET_REGION`), observatory relay or dev stub (`GUARDIAN_OBSERVATORY_RELAY_URL`, `GUARDIAN_OBSERVATORY_STUB`), federated learning (`GUARDIAN_FEDERATED_LEARNING`, `GUARDIAN_FEDERATED_MPC`), ONNX graph model (`GUARDIAN_FLEET_GRAPH_ONNX_MODEL`). Full list in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

---

## The web dashboard

**What it is:** A local website (default [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)) that shows what Guardian is doing.

**How it works:** When you run **`mcp-guardian start`** (or `pnpm dashboard:proxy` from a git clone), the same process serves the dashboard and the API. The UI reads real data from your history database — not fake demo numbers.

**Main areas:**

| Area | What you see |
|------|----------------|
| **Protection** | Overall status and plain-English analysis of your setup. |
| **Activity** | Audit log of allowed and blocked calls. |
| **Threats** | Active threats and quarantine actions. |
| **Security** | Security score and trends. |
| **Operations** | Traffic, errors, and cost charts over time. |
| **Agentic AI** | Autonomous features: trust, threats, policy, operations, audit, and tools. Industry roadmap panels (A1–C5, B1–B3) live here — plan compliance audit on **Overview**. |
| **Settings** | Servers, policy, and setup checklist. |

**Tip:** If charts say “no traffic in this time window,” widen the **Time window** dropdown (for example **Last 7 days**). Short windows only show very recent calls.

---

## Security Swarm (Pro)

**What it is:** A team of automated testers that keep trying to break your policy the way an attacker would.

**How it works:**

- One track **generates and runs attacks**, checks for bypasses, and writes reports.
- Another track **learns from real blocks** on your proxy and improves detection over time.
- The two tracks feed each other so tests get better as your deployment sees real traffic.

**Why it matters:** Your policy is only as strong as the attacks you have tested against; the swarm expands that set continuously.

Run: `pnpm security-swarm` (license required in production). Architecture diagram: [Architecture § Pro pipeline](#pro-pipeline-architecture) above.

---

## Threat Lab (Pro)

**What it is:** Uses a local AI model to **propose** new attack patterns and rule ideas based on what Guardian has seen.

**How it works:**

1. Collects signals from recent blocks, CVE data, and swarm findings.
2. The model suggests new test cases and possible policy lines.
3. Automated checks validate proposals.
4. **You review and approve** — nothing is applied automatically.

Run: `pnpm security-swarm:threat-lab` (needs Ollama or another configured LLM). See [THREAT_LAB.md](docs/THREAT_LAB.md).

## Auto Threat Research (Pro)

**What it is:** Background research when something interesting is blocked.

**How it works:** When the proxy blocks a suspicious call, events can be queued, grouped, and analyzed by an LLM to classify the attack type and add it to your research corpus. **It does not change your live policy by itself** — it builds knowledge for you to use later.

Enable with `GUARDIAN_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO=true` when licensed.

---

## Guardian Autopilot (Pro)

**What it is:** One-command setup: wrap MCP configs, start the proxy, turn on the dashboard, and optional background services (digests, learning).

**How it works:**

```bash
pnpm autopilot:init -- --apply
pnpm autopilot:start
```

See [AUTOPILOT.md](docs/AUTOPILOT.md).

## Free vs Pro

| | **Free (community)** | **Pro** |
|---|---------------------|--------|
| Policy proxy and YAML rules | Yes | Yes |
| Attack blocking, audit log, cost tracking | Yes | Yes |
| Harness and real-life scenarios | Yes | Yes |
| Full enterprise dashboard | Limited / dev bypass | Yes |
| Security Swarm, Threat Lab, Autopilot | No | Yes |
| Fleet, SSO, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL | No | Yes |

Local development can use `GUARDIAN_CI_BYPASS_LICENSE=true` with `pnpm dashboard:proxy`. Production Pro needs a license — [PRO_SETUP.md](docs/PRO_SETUP.md).

## Getting started — install, clone, and run

This section walks through every path to a working Guardian: **npm install** for day-to-day use, **git clone** for development, and **`mcp-guardian start`** (or `pnpm dashboard:proxy` from the repo) to run the **proxy + web dashboard** together on port **4000**.

> **npm note:** `mcp-guardian start`, `setup`, and `onboard --start` ship in **4.1.6** on GitHub. If `mcp-guardian start` is missing from help, your global install is older than 4.1.6 — use [git clone + build](#clone-and-set-up-for-development) below, or `npm install -g @mcp-guardian/server@4.1.6` once published. Full fixes: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

### What you need

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|--------|
| **Node.js 18+** | Required by `@mcp-guardian/server` |
| **npm** | For global install or running the published CLI |
| **pnpm** | Only if you develop from a git clone (`pnpm install`, `pnpm build`) |
| **Git** | Only for clone-from-source workflow |
| **Ollama** (optional) | Local LLM at `http://127.0.0.1:11434` for semantic detection, Threat Lab, and Auto Threat Research in dev |

---

### Install from npm (recommended for users)

Install the published server package. Pin **4.1.5+** — older 4.1.1–4.1.4 releases had broken `workspace:` metadata on npm. **4.1.6** adds `start` / `setup` (see GitHub `master` or npm once published).

```bash
# Global CLI (mcp-guardian command on your PATH)
npm install -g @mcp-guardian/server@latest

# Or install in a project directory
npm install @mcp-guardian/server@latest
```

Verify the CLI and install health:

```bash
mcp-guardian --version
mcp-guardian doctor
```

**What you get:** compiled `dist/`, default policy templates, prebuilt dashboard static files (`deploy/dashboard-spa/out/` in 4.1.6+), and the `mcp-guardian` CLI (`start`, `onboard`, `proxy`, `analyze`, `doctor`, etc.).

**Recommended flow after install:**

```bash
mcp-guardian onboard --apply
mcp-guardian start
```

Open **http://localhost:4000**. Or combine: `mcp-guardian onboard --apply --start` (4.1.6+).

**Manual proxy (advanced)** — only if you need custom env vars without `start`:

```bash
export DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true
export DASHBOARD_AUTH_DISABLED=true
export GUARDIAN_CI_BYPASS_LICENSE=true
export MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH="$HOME/.mcp-guardian/history.db"
mcp-guardian proxy --config guardian-configs/filesystem.json --policy policy-audit.yaml
```

---

### Clone and set up for development

Use this when you want the full repo: dashboard SPA, agentic modules, tests, Security Swarm, and `pnpm` scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudraneel93/mcp-guardian.git
cd mcp-guardian

# Install workspace dependencies (pnpm is required for the monorepo)
corepack enable
pnpm install

# Copy optional environment overrides
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you need NVD keys, LLM URLs, custom DB path, etc.

# Compile TypeScript + workspace packages + dashboard SPA (first time)
pnpm build
pnpm setup
# setup = pnpm install (if needed) + build + scripts/build-dashboard-spa.sh
# Alternative: pnpm dashboard:build
```

**One-liner after clone** (install + build everything):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudraneel93/mcp-guardian.git && cd mcp-guardian && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm setup
```

**Run from the repo without a global install:**

```bash
node dist/cli.js start
# or after linking: npm link && mcp-guardian start
```

---

### Configure environment

Guardian reads environment variables at startup. For local development, defaults in `scripts/start-dashboard-proxy.sh` are usually enough.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose | Default (dev) |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH` | SQLite audit/history DB | `~/.mcp-guardian/history.db` |
| `DASHBOARD_ENABLED` | REST API + web UI | `true` when using `mcp-guardian start` or `dashboard:proxy` |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | Dashboard URL port | `4000` |
| `DASHBOARD_AUTH_DISABLED` | Skip login on localhost | `true` in dev script |
| `GUARDIAN_CI_BYPASS_LICENSE` | Unlock Pro dashboard features locally | `true` in dev script |
| `GUARDIAN_LLM_ENABLED` | Semantic / AI features | `true` in dev script |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Local LLM endpoint | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` |
| `GUARDIAN_WS_ENABLED` | Live WebSocket metrics | `true` |

Example — use a repo-local database so tests and dashboard share the same file:

```bash
export MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH="$PWD/reports/local-history.db"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH")"
```

Full reference: [`.env.example`](.env.example).

---

### Start the dashboard and proxy (recommended)

**Primary command (npm global or git clone, 4.1.6+):**

```bash
mcp-guardian start
```

Sets local defaults (`DASHBOARD_ENABLED`, `MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH=~/.mcp-guardian/history.db`, license bypass for localhost), picks a single-server `guardian-configs/*.json` (or onboard `configsDir`), and runs proxy + API + UI.

**Custom config or policy:**

```bash
mcp-guardian start --config guardian-configs/filesystem.json --policy default-policy.yaml
mcp-guardian start --build-dashboard   # git clone: build SPA if out/ missing
```

**From the repo (dev script, same stack + extra dev env):**

```bash
pnpm dashboard:proxy
# or: pnpm dashboard:proxy -- guardian-configs/filesystem.json default-policy.yaml
```

**What this does:**

1. Rebuilds `dist/` if dashboard-related sources changed (dev script only)  
2. Builds the dashboard SPA (`deploy/dashboard-spa/out/`) if missing  
3. Picks a single-server MCP config unless you pass `--config`  
4. Starts **one Node process** that runs:
   - the **MCP proxy** (stdio to your upstream MCP server),
   - the **dashboard REST API**,
   - the **static web UI** at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/),
   - optional **agentic** schedulers and WebSocket push.

**Expected console output:**

```
[dashboard-proxy] DB: /Users/you/.mcp-guardian/history.db
[dashboard-proxy] Dashboard: http://localhost:4000/
[dashboard-proxy] Config: guardian-configs/filesystem.json  Policy: default-policy.yaml  Mode: block
```

Open the browser → **Protection**, **Activity**, **Agentic AI**, etc. If charts are empty, widen the time window (e.g. **Last 7 days**) or generate traffic (next section).

**Stop:** `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If port 4000 is stuck: `lsof -ti :4000 | xargs kill`.

---

### Dashboard UI development (hot reload)

When editing React panels under `deploy/dashboard-spa/`, run the SPA dev server separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — proxy + API (backend)
pnpm dashboard:proxy

# Terminal 2 — Next.js dev server for the SPA (frontend hot reload)
pnpm dashboard:dev
```

For SOC-style split API + UI: `pnpm soc:full` (API on 4040, SPA dev server — see `package.json`).

---

### Easiest path: onboard (wrap your AI client)

After **npm global install** (4.1.6+), let Guardian find and wrap MCP configs for Cursor, Claude Desktop, Cline, and Windsurf:

```bash
mcp-guardian onboard --apply
mcp-guardian start
```

`--apply` patches your live IDE MCP JSON (with backup). Restart your AI client so traffic flows through Guardian.

**If you see “No MCP config found for client auto”:**

- Install and configure an IDE with MCP first (Cursor, Cline, Claude Desktop, or Windsurf), **or**
- Pass a client: `mcp-guardian onboard --client cursor --apply`, **or**
- Pass a config file: `mcp-guardian onboard --config /path/to/mcp.json --apply`, **or**
- Skip onboard and start with a repo example: `mcp-guardian start --config guardian-configs/filesystem.json`

**Common config paths (macOS):**

| Client | Config file |
|--------|-------------|
| Cline | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

From a **git clone** (before/after build):

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm onboard -- --client auto --apply
# or: node dist/cli.js onboard --apply
```

---

### Run proxy without `start` (advanced)

Prefer **`mcp-guardian start`** — it sets the same env vars automatically. Use `proxy` directly only when you need full control:

```bash
export DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true
export DASHBOARD_PORT=4000
export MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH="$HOME/.mcp-guardian/history.db"
mcp-guardian proxy --config guardian-configs/filesystem.json --policy default-policy.yaml --blocking-mode block
```

**From repo:**

```bash
node dist/cli.js proxy --config guardian-configs/filesystem.json --policy default-policy.yaml
```

Without `DASHBOARD_ENABLED`, you get proxy-only (no web UI). Logs still go to `MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH`.

---

### Generate test traffic and verify

With **`mcp-guardian start`** or `pnpm dashboard:proxy` running in one terminal:

```bash
# Same DB as the proxy (important for dashboard charts)
export MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH="${MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH:-$HOME/.mcp-guardian/history.db}"

# Short live attack smoke test against the official filesystem MCP server
pnpm real-life:filesystem

# Offline policy matrix (no live MCP server required)
pnpm harness

# Plain-English summary of current posture
pnpm analyze

# Industry roadmap module audit (CLI)
node dist/cli.js roadmap audit
# or after global install: mcp-guardian roadmap audit
```

Refresh **http://localhost:4000/** → **Activity** / **Protection** should show new events.

Details: [scenarios/real-life/README.md](scenarios/real-life/README.md).

---

### Guardian Autopilot (one-command fleet setup)

Wraps configs, starts proxy, dashboard, and optional background jobs:

```bash
pnpm autopilot:init -- --apply
pnpm autopilot:start
pnpm autopilot:status
```

See [docs/PRO_SETUP.md](docs/PRO_SETUP.md) for production licensing (local dev uses `GUARDIAN_CI_BYPASS_LICENSE=true` with `mcp-guardian start` or `pnpm dashboard:proxy`).

---

### Web dashboard — what you will see

| Tab / area | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Protection** | Overall status, roadmap compliance strip (v4.1+) |
| **Activity** | Audit log of allowed and blocked `tools/call` |
| **Threats** | Active threats, quarantine, fleet chain graph (A1) |
| **Security** | Score and trends |
| **Operations** | Traffic, errors, cost charts |
| **Agentic AI** | Trust, policy gen, observatory, federated learning, plan compliance audit |
| **Settings** | Servers, policy, setup checklist |

The dashboard reads the **same SQLite DB** as the proxy (`MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH`). It is not a separate demo dataset.

Agentic features: [docs/AGENTIC_QUICKSTART.md](docs/AGENTIC_QUICKSTART.md) · [docs/AGENTIC_FEATURES.md](docs/AGENTIC_FEATURES.md).

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **`mcp-guardian start` not in help** | Global install is older than **4.1.6**. `git pull && pnpm build && node dist/cli.js start`, or `npm install -g @mcp-guardian/server@latest` when 4.1.6 is on npm |
| **`unknown option --start`** | Same — upgrade to 4.1.6 or run `onboard --apply` then `start` separately |
| **`InstallError` / `workspace:` on npm** | Use `@mcp-guardian/server@4.1.5+`, not 4.1.1–4.1.4; `npm cache clean --force` then reinstall |
| **`ETARGET` / No matching version for `@mcp-guardian/core`** | Publish chain incomplete — maintainers run `./scripts/publish-npm-all.sh` |
| **`next: command not found`** (dashboard build) | npm: reinstall package (prebuilt `out/` in 4.1.6). Git: `mcp-guardian setup` or `cd deploy/dashboard-spa && npm install && npm run build` |
| **`benchmark-report.json` missing`** | `git pull` — seed file must exist under `deploy/dashboard-spa/app/data/` |
| **`pnpm dashboard:proxy` not found** | Run from **repo root**, or use **`mcp-guardian start`** globally |
| **No MCP config found** | `mcp-guardian onboard --apply` or `mcp-guardian start --config guardian-configs/filesystem.json` |
| **Database disk I/O error** | Stop proxy; `rm -f ~/.mcp-guardian/history.db-wal history.db-shm history.db.pid`; `mcp-guardian start` |
| **Empty dashboard charts** | Same `MCP_GUARDIAN_DB_PATH` as proxy; widen time window; `pnpm real-life:filesystem` |
| **Port 4000 in use** | `lsof -ti :4000 \| xargs kill` or `DASHBOARD_PORT=4001 mcp-guardian start` |
| **`better-sqlite3` errors** (pnpm 10) | `pnpm approve-builds` → allow better-sqlite3 → `pnpm install` |
| **Ollama warning on start** | Optional — `ollama serve` for semantic / Threat Lab |
| **Pro features locked** | Production: [PRO_SETUP.md](docs/PRO_SETUP.md). Dev: use `mcp-guardian start` |
| **BundlePhobia / Socket badge** | Server package is Node-only; use [@mcp-guardian/core](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@mcp-guardian/core) for size analysis |

## Quick start (summary)

**From npm:**

```bash
npm install -g @mcp-guardian/server@latest
mcp-guardian onboard --apply
mcp-guardian start    # → http://localhost:4000/
```

**From git:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudraneel93/mcp-guardian.git && cd mcp-guardian
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm setup
mcp-guardian start
```

See **[Getting started — install, clone, and run](#getting-started--install-clone-and-run)** and **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)** for the full walkthrough and troubleshooting.

---

## The policy file

Rules live in `default-policy.yaml` (or a path you set). Example:

```yaml
version: '1.0'
policy:
  mode: block
  default_action: block

  rules:
    - name: allow-safe-tools
      description: Only allow read-only tools
      action: block
      tools:
        allow:
          - read_file
          - list_directory
          - search

    - name: block-shell-commands
      description: Never let the AI run shell commands
      action: block
      tools:
        deny:
          - bash
          - execute_command
          - eval

    - name: rate-limit
      description: Max 60 tool calls per minute
      action: block
      maxCallsPerMinute: 60
```

The bundled default policy already blocks many common attack patterns. You can extend it or start from templates in `policy-templates/`. Full reference: [POLICY.md](docs/POLICY.md).
