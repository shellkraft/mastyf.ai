### What's new in 4.1.7

- **Active Rules controls** — Security → Policy now includes list/search, soft disable/enable, and hard delete operations synced to YAML
- **Policy runtime semantics** — `enabled: false` is honored across rule strategies with backward-compatible defaults
- **Policy mutation APIs** — cloud + local dashboard endpoints for list/toggle/delete with updated README guidance

### What's new in 4.1.6

- **`mastyf-ai start`** — one command for proxy + web dashboard on port 4000 (local dev defaults)
- **`mastyf-ai setup`** — one-shot install for git clones (`pnpm install`, build, dashboard SPA)
- **npm tarball prep** — prebuilt dashboard UI (`deploy/dashboard-spa/out/`) built at pack time (publish pipeline not live yet)

### What's new in 4.1.0

**Industry roadmap plan compliance** — runtime verification and dashboard wiring for fleet-wide modules (A1–C5, B1–B3):

- **`mastyf-ai roadmap audit`** — CLI + `GET /api/agentic/plan-compliance/audit` verify shipped modules; exit 0 when production-ready
- **Dashboard Agentic AI panels** — plan compliance, reputation, zero-trust, federated learning, observatory mesh sync, sandbox wizard, chain graph (A1)
- **Protection home strip** — roadmap compliance score on the main Protection tab with link to Agentic AI
- **A1 ONNX graph path** — optional fleet chain classifier via `MASTYF_AI_FLEET_GRAPH_ONNX_MODEL`
- **B3 MPC-lite masking** — pairwise-masked federated gradients (`MASTYF_AI_FEDERATED_MPC`)
- **B2/B1 mesh relays** — observatory and reputation mesh publish/pull; dev stub via `MASTYF_AI_OBSERVATORY_STUB`
- **Cloud package scoring** — on-demand npm MCP trust scores, badge API, and `/certified` pages in `apps/cloud/`

Run `mastyf-ai roadmap audit --json` or open **Agentic AI → Overview** in the dashboard to confirm module compliance.

### What's new in 4.0.0

**Industry-standard MCP protection** — mastyf.ai moves from per-call filtering to fleet-wide, cross-agent security:

- **MTX v1** — open threat exchange format (`@mastyf-ai/mtx`) + cloud hub
- **Certified MCP** — HMAC attestation, persistent registry, verification API
- **Multi-step attack chains** — collusion detector + session-chain graph with proxy enforcement
- **Capability graph & intent binding** — tool/resource graph and session intent allowlists
- **Agent reputation ledger** — persistent scores with proxy enforcement
- **Dynamic sandbox tiers** — shadow / redact / allow with RL-ready persistence
- **Protocol fuzzer** — expanded corpus with real block validation and cert gates
- **Policy simulator** — `/api/policy/simulate` + `ab_test_policy` MCP tool
- **Incident playbooks & AI investigator** — webhook/isolate executors; Threat Lab–linked investigations
- **Compliance evidence runner** — live policy + audit wired to SOC2/HIPAA/PCI/FedRAMP/ISO mappings
- **mastyf-ai bench** — `mastyf-ai bench` CLI + public leaderboard at `/benchmarks`

**Roadmap (shipped in 4.0):** Semantic policy translator with approval flows, config provenance chain, STRIDE/LINDDUN threat modeling, behavioral biometrics, cross-MCP attack chains with SIEM export, digital twin sandbox, zero-trust SPIFFE scoring, decentralized reputation network, ecosystem observatory, insurance risk quantification + PDF export, and federated threat detection — see `src/agentic/industry-standard.ts` and module directories under `src/agentic/`.

### Fleet mandate for CISO buyers

mastyf.ai v4 is designed as a **fleet-wide control plane**, not a single-proxy filter:

- **Mandatory policy provenance** — every YAML change is hash-chained, signed, and exportable to SIEM/auditors
- **Human-in-the-loop policy approval** — NL drafts must pass simulation + explicit approval before apply
- **Cross-agent attack chain detection** — session graphs span servers; alerts export as CEF for Splunk/Datadog
- **SPIFFE/mTLS identity** — zero-trust composite scores include workload identity from SPIFFE SVIDs
- **Cloud observatory + reputation mesh** — anonymized fleet telemetry and server reputation consensus via the mastyf.ai cloud console
- **Insurance-ready risk reports** — ALE quantification with underwriter PDF export for cyber insurance workflows

---

## What problem does this solve?

Modern AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Cline, and others) can connect to **tools** — read files, run commands, query databases, post to Slack, and more. Those connections often use a standard called **MCP** (Model Context Protocol).

That power is useful, but risky:

- The AI might read files it should not see.
- It might run shell commands or delete data by mistake or because of a malicious prompt.
- Secrets can leak through tool arguments.
- API costs can spike without you noticing.
- You may install an npm MCP package without knowing its CVE posture or supply-chain risk.

**mastyf.ai helps on both sides:**

1. **Before install** — look up any npm MCP package for a 0–100 trust score and embeddable badge at [mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/certified](https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/certified) (no account required).
2. **After deploy** — run the self-hosted proxy so every tool request is checked against your rules, blocked when risky, and logged — **before** anything reaches your real tools.

```
Your AI assistant
       │
       ▼
  mastyf-ai proxy  ← reads your rules, blocks bad calls, keeps a log
       │
       ▼
  Your real tools (files, GitHub, database, …)
```

---

## How it works (step by step)

1. **You clone and build mastyf.ai** and point it at your existing MCP setup (or run `mastyf-ai onboard` to do this automatically).
2. **mastyf.ai wraps your tool servers** so the AI talks to mastyf.ai instead of talking to them directly.
3. When the AI tries to use a tool, mastyf.ai receives the request first.
4. mastyf.ai compares the request to your **policy** (a simple rules file you control).
5. If the request is allowed, mastyf.ai forwards it to the real tool and returns the result.
6. If the request breaks a rule, mastyf.ai **blocks it** and tells the AI it was denied — the real tool never runs.
7. Every allow and block is saved to a local database so you can review history and see charts on the dashboard.

You stay in control: mastyf.ai does not silently change your rules unless you approve it (for example when reviewing Threat Lab suggestions).

## Architecture

This section shows how mastyf.ai is wired together: what runs where, how a tool call flows through governance, and how Security Swarm / Threat Lab pipelines connect to the proxy.

**In this section:** System overview · Tool call path · Transports · Agentic AI · Dashboard · Security Swarm pipelines · Learning loop · Cloud app

### System overview

When you run **`mastyf-ai start`** or `pnpm dashboard:proxy`, one Node process typically hosts the **policy proxy**, the **dashboard API**, and (optionally) **agentic services**. All components share the same audit database (`MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH`, default `~/.mastyf-ai/history.db`).

| Component | Role | Main code |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| **Proxy layer** | Intercepts JSON-RPC; enforces policy on every `tools/call` | [`src/proxy/`](src/proxy/) |
| **Policy engine** | Evaluates YAML rules, rate limits, RBAC, patterns | [`src/policy/`](src/policy/) |
| **History DB** | Stores allow/block audit, tokens, cost | [`src/database/history-db.ts`](src/database/history-db.ts) |
| **Dashboard** | Local UI + REST API over the same DB | [`deploy/dashboard-spa/`](deploy/dashboard-spa/), [`src/utils/dashboard-server.ts`](src/utils/dashboard-server.ts) |
| **Agentic** | Smart features (injection scan, policy gen, trust, mesh, etc.) | [`src/agentic/`](src/agentic/) |
| **Cloud app** | Public scores, badges, org console (not on npm) | [`apps/cloud/`](apps/cloud/) |

Enterprise deployments may add **Redis** (rate limits, DPoP, circuit-breaker sync) and **PostgreSQL** instead of SQLite — see [`deploy/helm/`](deploy/helm/) and [`packages/PACKAGING.md`](packages/PACKAGING.md).

### Tool call path (`tools/call`)

Every dangerous decision happens **before** the real MCP server runs. If mastyf.ai blocks a call, the upstream tool never receives it.

```
AI client → pre-forward guard → policy engine → semantic gate → audit → upstream MCP
                ↓ blocked anywhere = upstream never called
```

**Integration details:**

1. **Pre-forward guard** ([`src/proxy/tool-call-pre-guard.ts`](src/proxy/tool-call-pre-guard.ts)) — caps expanded argument size and runs agentic pre-hooks (prompt injection, etc.) on all transports.
2. **Policy** ([`src/policy/policy-engine.ts`](src/policy/policy-engine.ts)) — your YAML rules; rate-limit counters survive hot-reload via [`src/policy/rate-limit-store.ts`](src/policy/rate-limit-store.ts).
3. **Semantic gate** ([`src/proxy/proxy-post-policy-gates.ts`](src/proxy/proxy-post-policy-gates.ts)) — optional LLM/heuristic check on arguments before forward.
4. **Audit** — `persistCallRecord` → async audit-write-queue → SQLite; blocks also emit structured SIEM events when enabled.

### Transports

mastyf.ai implements the same governance stack on every MCP transport your IDE might use:

| Transport | Entry module | `tools/call` governance |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| **stdio** | [`src/proxy/proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/proxy-server.ts) | Full pipeline (default for wrapped configs) |
| **HTTP** | [`src/proxy/http-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/http-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |
| **SSE** | [`src/proxy/sse-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/sse-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |
| **WebSocket** | [`src/proxy/websocket-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/websocket-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |
| **Streamable HTTP** | [`src/proxy/streamable-http-proxy-server.ts`](src/proxy/streamable-http-proxy-server.ts) | Full + pre-forward guard |

Run `mastyf-ai onboard` so client configs point at mastyf.ai-wrapped servers. If an IDE connects to an MCP server **around** the proxy (common with raw SSE URLs), calls are **untracked** — metrics and logs will show `sse_untracked`.

### Agentic AI integration

Agentic features are optional modules loaded at boot ([`src/container.ts`](src/container.ts)). They do not replace your YAML policy; they add observation, scoring, and recommendations.

| Integration point | What happens |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Every `tools/call`** | [`runAgenticPreForwardHooks`](src/agentic/proxy-integration.ts) can block or sanitize arguments when agentic mode is on |
| **MCP tools** | ~70+ agentic tools registered in [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) for automation and dashboard actions |
| **Modules** | 40+ agentic modules in [`src/agentic/`](src/agentic/) (prediction, policy-gen, mesh, collusion, reputation, drift, compliance, etc.) |
| **Dashboard** | **Agentic AI** workspace reads [`/api/agentic/*`](src/utils/agentic-dashboard-summary.ts) summaries |
| **Database** | Agentic state in [`011-agentic-tables.sql`](src/database/migrations/011-agentic-tables.sql) |

Module directories (each implements a shipped capability): `threat-prediction`, `policy-gen`, `prompt-injection`, `threat-mesh`, `honeypot`, `supply-chain`, `compliance`, `drift`, `red-team`, `protocol-fuzzer`, `trust-negotiation`, `trust-score`, `collusion-detector`, `capability-graph`, `intent-binding`, `agent-reputation`, `sandbox-tier`, `certification`, `incident-playbook`, `response-dlp`, `rl`, `mcp-lifecycle`, `cross-chain`, `digital-twin`, `biometrics`, `provenance`, `threat-modeling`, `zero-trust`, `observatory`, `federated`, `reputation`, `insurance`, `semantic-policy`, and related helpers in `core.ts` / `scheduler.ts`.

### Dashboard and observability

```
Proxy writes → history.db → Dashboard REST API → Next.js SPA (Protection, Activity, Agentic)
                          → WebSocket push (MASTYF_AI_WS_ENABLED)
                          → Prometheus metrics (optional)
                          → SIEM exporters (MASTYF_AI_SIEM_ENABLED)
```

The dashboard is not a separate database — it reads the same `call_records` the proxy writes. Set `MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH` consistently when running `pnpm real-life:filesystem` or other tests so charts match proxy traffic.

### Security Swarm pipeline architecture

These workflows run **alongside** the live proxy. They consume audit data, swarm reports, and LLM output to improve detection — they do not sit in the hot path of every tool call.

#### Security Swarm

Automated red-team loop: generate attacks, run the harness, detect bypasses, feed learning.

- **What it does:** Runs scripted steps (build, corpus eval, parity, harness) and records bypasses when policy allows an attack that should be blocked.
- **How it connects:** Reads/writes under `reports/security-swarm/`; bypasses and proposals can inform Threat Lab and runtime attack-learning.
- **Run:** `pnpm security-swarm:fast` (PR gate) or `pnpm security-swarm:analyze` (full analysis). See [`security-swarm/README.md`](security-swarm/README.md).

#### Threat Lab (LLM discovery)

Human-reviewed LLM proposals for new attack fixtures and policy ideas.

- **What it does:** Collects signals (bypasses, semantic TPs, ThreatIntel), asks a local LLM for new corpus candidates, validates them, writes `threat-lab-candidates.json` for **you to accept**.
- **How it connects:** Outputs feed the adversarial harness and optional policy-applier after review — nothing is applied silently.
- **Run:** `pnpm security-swarm:threat-lab` (requires Ollama at `http://127.0.0.1:11434`).

#### Auto Threat Research

Background LLM research when the proxy blocks suspicious traffic; writes validated `adv-*.json` fixtures.

- **What it does:** Debounces block events, classifies attack types, writes harness fixtures when validation passes (dedupe + rate caps).
- **How it connects:** Uses the same auto-corpus writer as Threat Lab when both `MASTYF_AI_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO` and `SWARM_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO` are enabled.
- **Run:** Enable env flags on the proxy host; or trigger from dashboard **Threat Discovery**.

### Continuous improvement loop

```
Live proxy blocks → history.db → Security Swarm + Threat Lab + Auto Threat Research
                                      ↓
                         new fixtures & policy ideas (human review)
                                      ↓
                         adversarial harness + corpus → stronger default policy
```

### Cloud app (`apps/cloud`)

The Next.js app powers the live website at [mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app](https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/). It is **not** published to npm.

| Route / API | What it does |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `/certified` | Look up npm MCP packages; 0–100 trust score and grade |
| `/api/v1/badge/<package>` | SVG or JSON trust badge for README embeds |
| `/api/v1/deep-scan/<package>` | Optional live MCP probe (stdio via `npx`) |
| `/dashboard` | Free org console — policy YAML, API keys, fleet |
| `/observatory` | Anonymized fleet telemetry snapshot |
| `/benchmarks` | Community proxy profile leaderboard |

## Features explained

Below is what each major capability does, in plain language.

### mastyf.ai website — security scores & badges

**What it is:** A public lookup for npm MCP package trust — no install required.

**How it works:** Enter a package name at [`/certified`](https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/certified). Static analysis runs on npm metadata, CVE feeds, and registry signals. You get a 0–100 score, letter grade, category breakdown, and copy-paste badge markdown. Optional deep scan connects to the package over stdio when enabled.

**Why it matters:** Teams can check supply-chain posture before agents touch production data.

```bash
curl -s "https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/api/v1/badge/@playwright%2Fmcp/json"
```

---

### mastyf.ai cloud console

**What it is:** A free signed-in console for policy and fleet management — hosted, no self-hosted proxy required.

**How it works:** Sign in with Google or GitHub at [`/dashboard`](https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/dashboard). Edit policy YAML in the browser, publish changes, rotate API keys, and view self-hosted proxy heartbeats when linked.

**Why it matters:** Policy and tenant management without running the full proxy stack locally.

---

### Policy proxy (the core)

**What it is:** A filter on every tool call.

**How it works:** You write rules in a YAML file (see [The policy file](#the-policy-file) below). Rules can allow specific tools, deny dangerous ones, limit how often tools run, cap token usage, and match patterns in arguments (for example “block if the path contains `../`”). When you change the file, mastyf.ai can reload rules without restarting.

**Why it matters:** This is your main line of defense — fast, predictable, and fully under your control.

---

### Attack blocking (built into the default policy)

**What it is:** Hundreds of pre-written checks for common abuse.

**How it works:** Before a call reaches your server, mastyf.ai looks for things like shell commands hidden in arguments, path traversal (`../etc/passwd`), SQL injection patterns, attempts to exfiltrate secrets, suspicious URLs, and Unicode tricks that hide malicious text. If a pattern matches, the call is blocked and logged.

**Why it matters:** Many real-world attacks look like normal tool calls; these checks catch a large class of them without an AI model.

---

### Cost tracking

**What it is:** A running tally of how much your tool usage costs.

**How it works:** mastyf.ai estimates tokens and dollar cost per call (using model pricing when available). You can set budgets and see burn rate over time in the dashboard.

**Why it matters:** Runaway agents or loops can get expensive; you see it early.

---

### Health monitoring

**What it is:** A health check for each connected MCP server.

**How it works:** mastyf.ai tracks success rate, latency, and whether a server is responding. If a server keeps failing, a circuit breaker can stop hammering it.

**Why it matters:** You notice broken or flaky integrations before users complain.

---

### Live audit log

**What it is:** A permanent record of what was allowed and what was blocked.

**How it works:** Each decision is stored in a local SQLite database (default: `~/.mastyf-ai/history.db`). The dashboard reads this database to show tables, charts, and filters.

**Why it matters:** Security and debugging need a clear trail — who tried what, when, and why it was blocked.

---

### Package scanning (CVE and typo-squat)

**What it is:** A check on MCP packages before you trust them.

**How it works:** mastyf.ai can scan installed or configured packages for known security issues (CVEs) and names that look like famous packages but are slightly misspelled (typo-squatting). CLI: `mastyf-ai scan --all`.

**Why it matters:** Supply-chain attacks often arrive as “almost the right” package name.

---

### Adversarial harness (offline tests)

**What it is:** A large automated test suite that fires attack-like requests at your policy **without** a live AI.

**How it works:** Run `pnpm harness` from the repo. It replays **~835 fixtures** and reports what would be blocked or allowed. Node/Python parity compares **~813** fixtures via `pnpm harness:parity`.

**Why it matters:** You can change rules and immediately see if you broke legitimate use or left a hole open.

---

### Real-life scenarios (live tests)

**What it is:** A short or long run of real attack traffic against a real filesystem MCP server through mastyf.ai.

**How it works:** Commands like `pnpm real-life:filesystem` drive the official filesystem server with path traversal, injection, and similar tests while the proxy is running. Results show up in the dashboard if you use the same database path.

**Why it matters:** Offline tests are fast; live tests prove the full path (proxy → policy → log → UI) works.

---

### Industry-standard roadmap (shipped in 4.0)

mastyf.ai’s industry-standard layer delivers **cross-server, cross-agent, systemic** protection. All eleven capabilities shipped in v4.0:

| Tier | Features | Theme |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| **1 — Paradigm** | A1 Cross-MCP attack chain detection · A2 Digital twin & policy sandbox · A3 Agent behavioral biometrics | See the forest, not just the trees |
| **2 — Ecosystem** | B1 Decentralized reputation network · B2 Ecosystem health observatory · B3 Federated threat detection | Network effects across deployments |
| **3 — Enterprise** | C1 Config provenance chain · C2 Threat modeling as code (STRIDE/LINDDUN) · C3 Zero-trust continuous verification · C4 Insurance risk quantification · C5 Semantic policy translator | Compliance, CFO, and business stakeholders |

**Verify compliance:** Run `mastyf-ai roadmap audit` (or `--json` for machine-readable output). The dashboard **Agentic AI → Overview** tab shows the same runtime audit via **Industry Roadmap Compliance**. Additional CLI utilities: `mastyf-ai roadmap fleet-graph-train`, `federated-export|import`, `observatory-sync`, `reputation-sync`.

**Production env vars** (optional): fleet chain blocking (`MASTYF_AI_FLEET_CHAIN_BLOCK_CONFIDENCE`), multi-region Redis (`MASTYF_AI_FLEET_REGION`), observatory relay or dev stub (`MASTYF_AI_OBSERVATORY_RELAY_URL`, `MASTYF_AI_OBSERVATORY_STUB`), federated learning (`MASTYF_AI_FEDERATED_LEARNING`, `MASTYF_AI_FEDERATED_MPC`), ONNX graph model (`MASTYF_AI_FLEET_GRAPH_ONNX_MODEL`). Full list in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

---

## The web dashboard

**What it is:** A local website (default [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)) that shows what mastyf.ai is doing.

**How it works:** When you run **`mastyf-ai start`** (or `pnpm dashboard:proxy` from a git clone), the same process serves the dashboard and the API. The UI reads real data from your history database — not fake demo numbers.

**Main areas:**

| Area | What you see |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Protection** | Overall status and plain-English analysis of your setup. |
| **Activity** | Audit log of allowed and blocked calls. |
| **Threats** | Active threats and quarantine actions. |
| **Security** | Security score and trends. |
| **Operations** | Traffic, errors, and cost charts over time. |
| **Agentic AI** | Autonomous features: trust, threats, policy, operations, audit, and tools. Industry roadmap panels (A1–C5, B1–B3) live here — plan compliance audit on **Overview**. |
| **Settings** | Servers, policy, and setup checklist. |

In **Security → Policy**, you can manage rules without hand-editing YAML:

- **Active Rules list** with search/filter
- **Soft disable/enable** (writes `enabled: false/true` on the rule)
- **Hard delete** (removes the rule from `policy.rules[]`)
- Editor stays in sync with structured actions so YAML remains source-of-truth

**Tip:** If charts say “no traffic in this time window,” widen the **Time window** dropdown (for example **Last 7 days**). Short windows only show very recent calls.

---

## Security Swarm

**What it is:** A team of automated testers that keep trying to break your policy the way an attacker would.

**How it works:**

- One track **generates and runs attacks**, checks for bypasses, and writes reports.
- Another track **learns from real blocks** on your proxy and improves detection over time.
- The two tracks feed each other so tests get better as your deployment sees real traffic.

**Why it matters:** Your policy is only as strong as the attacks you have tested against; the swarm expands that set continuously.

**Run:**

```bash
pnpm security-swarm:fast      # PR gate (~5–15 min)
pnpm security-swarm:analyze   # full analysis + live MCP scenarios
```

Architecture and artifacts: [`security-swarm/README.md`](security-swarm/README.md) · [Architecture § Security Swarm pipeline](#security-swarm-pipeline-architecture) above.

---

## Threat Lab

**What it is:** Uses a local AI model to **propose** new attack patterns and rule ideas based on what mastyf.ai has seen.

**How it works:**

1. Collects signals from recent blocks, CVE data, and swarm findings.
2. The model suggests new test cases and possible policy lines.
3. Automated checks validate proposals.
4. **You review and approve** — nothing is applied automatically.

**Run:**

```bash
pnpm security-swarm:threat-lab
# Requires Ollama at http://127.0.0.1:11434
```

---

## Auto Threat Research

**What it is:** Background research when something interesting is blocked.

**How it works:** When the proxy blocks a suspicious call, events can be queued, grouped, and analyzed by an LLM to classify the attack type and add it to your research corpus. **It does not change your live policy by itself** — it builds knowledge for you to use later.

**Enable:**

```bash
export MASTYF_AI_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO=true
export SWARM_THREAT_RESEARCH_AUTO=true
pnpm security-swarm:auto-threat-research
```

---

## mastyf.ai Autopilot

**What it is:** One-command setup: wrap MCP configs, start the proxy, turn on the dashboard, and optional background services (digests, learning).

**How it works:**

```bash
pnpm autopilot:init -- --apply
pnpm autopilot:start
pnpm autopilot:status
```

Or via CLI: `mastyf-ai autopilot init` / `mastyf-ai autopilot start`.

---

## Open source vs optional license enforcement

This repository is **MIT licensed**. All proxy, policy, dashboard, swarm, and agentic code ships in the repo.

| Capability | Default (MIT) | With `MASTYF_AI_REQUIRE_LICENSE=true` |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Policy proxy and YAML rules | Yes | Yes |
| Attack blocking, audit log, cost tracking | Yes | Yes |
| Harness and real-life scenarios | Yes | Yes |
| Full dashboard + Security Swarm | Yes | Yes (requires valid cloud API key) |
| Fleet, SSO, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL | Yes (self-hosted) | Yes |

By default, feature gating is **off** — everything in the repo runs without a license key. Set `MASTYF_AI_REQUIRE_LICENSE=true` plus `MASTYF_AI_LICENSE_KEY` and `MASTYF_AI_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` only when you want cloud-enforced licensing in production.

Local development: `MASTYF_AI_CI_BYPASS_LICENSE=true` with `pnpm dashboard:proxy` or `mastyf-ai start`.

---

## Getting started — install, clone, and run

This section walks through every path to a working mastyf.ai: **git clone** (current recommended path), and **`mastyf-ai start`** (or `pnpm dashboard:proxy` from the repo) to run the **proxy + web dashboard** together on port **4000**.

> **npm note:** The package name `@mastyf-ai/server` and CLI `mastyf-ai` are defined in this repo but **not yet published to npm**. Install from source below. When npm publish is live, `npm install -g @mastyf-ai/server` will be the recommended user path.

### What you need

| Requirement | Notes |
| ----------- | ----- |
| **Node.js 18+** | Required |
| **pnpm** | Required for the monorepo (`pnpm install`, `pnpm build`) |
| **Git** | Clone-from-source workflow |
| **Postgres** | Cloud console local dev only (`DATABASE_URL` in `apps/cloud/.env.local`) |
| **Ollama** (optional) | Local LLM at http://127.0.0.1:11434 for semantic detection, Threat Lab, and Auto Threat Research |

---

### Clone and set up (recommended today)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mastyf-ai/mastyf.ai.git
cd mastyf.ai

# Install workspace dependencies (pnpm is required for the monorepo)
corepack enable
pnpm install

# Copy optional environment overrides
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you need NVD keys, LLM URLs, custom DB path, etc.

# Compile TypeScript + workspace packages + dashboard SPA (first time)
pnpm build
pnpm setup
# setup = pnpm install (if needed) + build + scripts/build-dashboard-spa.sh
```

**One-liner after clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mastyf-ai/mastyf.ai.git && cd mastyf.ai && pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm setup
```

**Run from the repo without a global install:**

```bash
node dist/cli.js start
# or: pnpm dashboard:proxy
```

Verify install health:

```bash
node dist/cli.js --version
node dist/cli.js doctor
```

---

### Configure environment

mastyf.ai reads environment variables at startup. For local development, defaults in `scripts/start-dashboard-proxy.sh` are usually enough.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose | Default (dev) |
| -------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH` | SQLite audit/history DB | `~/.mastyf-ai/history.db` |
| `DASHBOARD_ENABLED` | REST API + web UI | `true` when using `mastyf-ai start` or `dashboard:proxy` |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | Dashboard URL port | `4000` |
| `DASHBOARD_AUTH_DISABLED` | Skip login on localhost | `true` in dev script |
| `MASTYF_AI_CI_BYPASS_LICENSE` | Local dev license bypass | `true` in dev script |
| `MASTYF_AI_LLM_ENABLED` | Semantic / AI features | `true` in dev script |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Local LLM endpoint | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` |
| `MASTYF_AI_WS_ENABLED` | Live WebSocket metrics | `true` |
| `MASTYF_AI_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` | Cloud console URL for policy sync | `https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app` |

Example — use a repo-local database so tests and dashboard share the same file:

```bash
export MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH="$PWD/reports/local-history.db"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH")"
```

Full reference: [`.env.example`](.env.example).

---

### Start the dashboard and proxy (recommended)

**Primary command (after build):**

```bash
mastyf-ai start
# or from repo without global link:
node dist/cli.js start
```

Sets local defaults (`DASHBOARD_ENABLED`, `MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH=~/.mastyf-ai/history.db`, license bypass for localhost), picks a single-server `mastyf-ai-configs/*.json` (or onboard `configsDir`), and runs proxy + API + UI.

**Custom config or policy:**

```bash
mastyf-ai start --config mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json --policy default-policy.yaml
mastyf-ai start --build-dashboard   # git clone: build SPA if out/ missing
```

**From the repo (dev script, same stack + extra dev env):**

```bash
pnpm dashboard:proxy
# or: pnpm dashboard:proxy -- mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json default-policy.yaml
```

**What this does:**

1. Rebuilds `dist/` if dashboard-related sources changed (dev script only)
2. Builds the dashboard SPA (`deploy/dashboard-spa/out/`) if missing
3. Picks a single-server MCP config unless you pass `--config`
4. Starts **one Node process** that runs:
   - the **MCP proxy** (stdio to your upstream MCP server),
   - the **dashboard REST API**,
   - the **static web UI** at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/),
   - optional **agentic** schedulers and WebSocket push.

**Expected console output:**

```
[dashboard-proxy] DB: /Users/you/.mastyf-ai/history.db
[dashboard-proxy] Dashboard: http://localhost:4000/
[dashboard-proxy] Config: mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json  Policy: default-policy.yaml  Mode: block
```

Open the browser → **Protection**, **Activity**, **Agentic AI**, etc. If charts are empty, widen the time window (e.g. **Last 7 days**) or generate traffic (next section).

**Stop:** `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If port 4000 is stuck: `lsof -ti :4000 | xargs kill`.

---

### Dashboard UI development (hot reload)

When editing React panels under `deploy/dashboard-spa/`, run the SPA dev server separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — proxy + API (backend)
pnpm dashboard:proxy

# Terminal 2 — Next.js dev server for the SPA (frontend hot reload)
pnpm dashboard:dev
```

---

### Easiest path: onboard (wrap your AI client)

After **build**, let mastyf.ai find and wrap MCP configs for Cursor, Claude Desktop, Cline, and Windsurf:

```bash
mastyf-ai onboard --apply
mastyf-ai start
```

`--apply` patches your live IDE MCP JSON (with backup). Restart your AI client so traffic flows through mastyf.ai.

**If you see “No MCP config found for client auto”:**

- Install and configure an IDE with MCP first (Cursor, Cline, Claude Desktop, or Windsurf), **or**
- Pass a client: `mastyf-ai onboard --client cursor --apply`, **or**
- Pass a config file: `mastyf-ai onboard --config /path/to/mcp.json --apply`, **or**
- Skip onboard and start with a repo example: `mastyf-ai start --config mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json`

**Common config paths (macOS):**

| Client | Config file |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Cline | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

From a **git clone** (before/after build):

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm onboard -- --client auto --apply
# or: node dist/cli.js onboard --apply
```

---

### Run proxy without `start` (advanced)

Prefer **`mastyf-ai start`** — it sets the same env vars automatically. Use `proxy` directly only when you need full control:

```bash
export DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true
export DASHBOARD_PORT=4000
export MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH="$HOME/.mastyf-ai/history.db"
mastyf-ai proxy --config mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json --policy default-policy.yaml --blocking-mode block
```

**From repo:**

```bash
node dist/cli.js proxy --config mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json --policy default-policy.yaml
```

Without `DASHBOARD_ENABLED`, you get proxy-only (no web UI). Logs still go to `MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH`.

---

### Generate test traffic and verify

With **`mastyf-ai start`** or `pnpm dashboard:proxy` running in one terminal:

```bash
# Same DB as the proxy (important for dashboard charts)
export MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH="${MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH:-$HOME/.mastyf-ai/history.db}"

# Short live attack smoke test against the official filesystem MCP server
pnpm real-life:filesystem

# Offline policy matrix (no live MCP server required)
pnpm harness

# Plain-English summary of current posture
pnpm analyze

# Industry roadmap module audit (CLI)
node dist/cli.js roadmap audit
# or after global link: mastyf-ai roadmap audit
```

Refresh **http://localhost:4000/** → **Activity** / **Protection** should show new events.

Details: [`scenarios/real-life/README.md`](scenarios/real-life/README.md).

---

### Website (cloud app) local dev

```bash
cp apps/cloud/.env.example apps/cloud/.env.local
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
# AUTH_DEV_LOGIN=true

pnpm cloud:dev
# → http://localhost:3001
```

---

### mastyf.ai Autopilot (one-command fleet setup)

Wraps configs, starts proxy, dashboard, and optional background jobs:

```bash
pnpm autopilot:init -- --apply
pnpm autopilot:start
pnpm autopilot:status
```

---

### Web dashboard — what you will see

| Tab / area | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| **Protection** | Overall status, roadmap compliance strip (v4.1+) |
| **Activity** | Audit log of allowed and blocked `tools/call` |
| **Threats** | Active threats, quarantine, fleet chain graph (A1) |
| **Security** | Score, trends, and **Policy Studio** with Active Rules controls |
| **Operations** | Traffic, errors, cost charts; Security Swarm job status |
| **Agentic AI** | Trust, policy gen, observatory, federated learning, plan compliance audit |
| **Settings** | Servers, policy, setup checklist |

The dashboard reads the **same SQLite DB** as the proxy (`MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH`). It is not a separate demo dataset.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| ------- | --- |
| **`mastyf-ai start` not found** | Build from clone: `pnpm build && node dist/cli.js start`. npm global install not available until `@mastyf-ai/server` is published. |
| **`pnpm dashboard:proxy` not found** | Run from **repo root**, or use **`node dist/cli.js start`** |
| **No MCP config found** | `mastyf-ai onboard --apply` or `mastyf-ai start --config mastyf-ai-configs/filesystem.json` |
| **Database disk I/O error** | Stop proxy; `rm -f ~/.mastyf-ai/history.db-wal history.db-shm history.db.pid`; restart |
| **Empty dashboard charts** | Same `MASTYF_AI_DB_PATH` as proxy; widen time window; `pnpm real-life:filesystem` |
| **Port 4000 in use** | `lsof -ti :4000 \| xargs kill` or `DASHBOARD_PORT=4001 mastyf-ai start` |
| **better-sqlite3 errors** (pnpm 10) | `pnpm approve-builds` → allow `better-sqlite3` → `pnpm install` |
| **Ollama warning on start** | Optional — `ollama serve` for semantic / Threat Lab |
| **Swarm stuck at 75%** | Check `reports/tenants/default/security-swarm/job.log`; re-run from dashboard |
| **Cloud sign-in fails locally** | Set `AUTH_DEV_LOGIN=true` and `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/cloud/.env.local` |
| **next: command not found** (dashboard build) | Run `pnpm setup` or `cd deploy/dashboard-spa && npm install && npm run build` |

---

## Quick start (summary)

**From git (recommended today):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mastyf-ai/mastyf.ai.git && cd mastyf.ai
pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm setup
node dist/cli.js onboard --apply
node dist/cli.js start    # → http://localhost:4000/
```

**Use the website (no install):**

Open [https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/certified](https://mastyf-ai-cloud-jet.vercel.app/certified) and enter an npm MCP package name.

See **Getting started — install, clone, and run** above for the full walkthrough.

---

## The policy file

Rules live in `default-policy.yaml` (or a path you set). Example:

```yaml
version: '1.0'
policy:
  mode: block
  default_action: block

  rules:
    - name: allow-safe-tools
      description: Only allow read-only tools
      action: block
      tools:
        allow:
          - read_file
          - list_directory
          - search

    - name: block-shell-commands
      description: Never let the AI run shell commands
      action: block
      tools:
        deny:
          - bash
          - execute_command
          - eval

    - name: rate-limit
      description: Max 60 tool calls per minute
      action: block
      maxCallsPerMinute: 60
```

The bundled default policy already blocks many common attack patterns. You can extend it or start from templates in [`policy-templates/`](policy-templates/).
